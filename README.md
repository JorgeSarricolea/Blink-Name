## Introduction

The "Blink Name" program is a Java Swing application that showcases a dynamic and colorful blinking effect for a given name. The application employs multithreading to change the color of the displayed name at regular intervals, creating an eye-catching visual effect. This project serves as a simple yet engaging demonstration of concurrent programming and graphical user interface manipulation in Java.

## Getting Started

To get started with "Blink Name", follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

**Java:** Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/JorgeSarricolea/Blink-Name.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Blink-Name
```
3. Compile and run the game using the following command:
```
javac Blink-Name.java && java Blink-Name
```

## Features

- **Dynamic Color Blinking:** The main feature of the program is the dynamic color change of the displayed name at regular intervals. The name cycles through a predefined set of vibrant colors, enhancing the visual appeal.
- **Multithreading:** The application utilizes a separate thread (ColorChanger) to handle the color-changing functionality independently. This ensures that the user interface remains responsive while the color transitions occur in the background.
- **Thread Information Logging:** The program provides additional insights into the color-changing process by printing thread information, including the current thread's name and the associated color, to the terminal. This demonstrates the concurrent nature of the application.
